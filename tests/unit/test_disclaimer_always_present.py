"""Every answer carries a liability trailer -- the good ones and the failures alike.

Rule (user, 2026-08-28): output ALWAYS ends with a disclaimer. An error message is not
exempt; it is the case that matters most, because a reader who just got a half-answer is
the reader most likely to act on it anyway.

Language rule, asserted here rather than trusted:

    answer in English  -> English trailer
    answer in Japanese -> Japanese trailer
    NO readable language in the message at all -> BOTH

Note the third line. It used to read "language unknown, or the message is about
unreadable input", and that conflated two different things. An input the agent could
not ACT on is not an input it could not READ: a Japanese speaker whose request failed
to parse still wrote in Japanese, and answering them with an English block plus a
translation underneath says the agent never worked out who it was talking to. Bilingual
is for the case where there is genuinely nothing to read -- punctuation, digits, an
empty line. Measured on twelve repos, 2026-09-04.

Copy this file verbatim into `tests/unit/test_disclaimer_always_present.py` and fill the
markers at the bottom. Everything above them stays byte-identical fleet-wide -- one
patch, `cp`, `sha256sum`, the same mechanism as `kb_port.py` and the live-path test.
