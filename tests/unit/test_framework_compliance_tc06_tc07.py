"""TC-06 / TC-07 — the FunctionNode final security gates are non-overridable.

`FunctionNode._security_gate_input` and `._security_gate_output` are `@final`
(the framework enforces the PII scan on input and the credential scan on output).
A domain subclass that tries to override either must fail at class-definition
time with `TypeError`, and domain-specific checks must go through the sanctioned
`_extra_security_gate_input()` / `_extra_security_gate_output()` extension hooks.

Repo-agnostic: depends only on the framework surface, so it protects the gate
contract for every template regardless of its concrete node classes.
